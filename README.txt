Allien Call (Study Project)

This project is a 2D space shooter game built with Python and Pygame as part of my personal study
in game development. The game includes multiple alien types (Green, Red, and Cyan),
 each with unique movement patterns, and wave-based spawning systems.

The main goal of this project is to practice programming logic, object-oriented design, 
and sprite management in Pygame while creating something fun and interactive.

Itâ€™s still in development and mainly serves as a learning exercise rather than a finished game.
i hope one day i make real fantastic games
